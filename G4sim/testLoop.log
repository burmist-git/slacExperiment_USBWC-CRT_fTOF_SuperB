In your environment you have the G4WORKDIR=/afs/in2p3.fr/home/n/narnaud/geant4

LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to include CLHEP and Geant4 libraries. 

NOTE : verify that the correct path for the CLHEP library
- $CLHEP_BASE_DIR/lib - is included in the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
variable in your environment, and no other outdated installations
of CLHEP are by chance referenced through $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and
