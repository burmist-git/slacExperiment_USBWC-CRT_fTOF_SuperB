Sequence of jobs:
-----------------

[The embedded loops should be the same in all scripts. This will
ensure that all sets of parameters are processed along the chain of jobs]

1) testLoop in /afs/in2p3.fr/home/n/narnaud/FTOF/fTOF_2DMaps/trunk/
[1 job takes ~hours to be completed]

2) produce2DMaps in /afs/in2p3.fr/home/n/narnaud/FTOF/fTOF_2DMaps/trunk/ana_sel
[jobs are quite fast: a few minutes at most]

3) analyze2DMaps in /afs/in2p3.fr/home/n/narnaud/FTOF/fTOF_2DMaps/trunk/ana_sel
[That's where to start if one just wants to inject different amounts of bkg]

4) analyzeReco in /afs/in2p3.fr/home/n/narnaud/FTOF/fTOF_2DMaps/trunk/ana_sel
